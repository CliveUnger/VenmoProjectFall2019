# Logistical challenges

While our primary issues arose from technical issues, there were also certain time management and logistical challenges that slowed progress.
First, I (Clive) enrolled in the Independent Study in Journalism course so that I could receive class credit for the work I was doing in the lab.
I was expecting that Dr. Murthy would have some project idea for me to work on, and I would simple perform that data analytics for that project.
Instead he appointed me as the project lead for a research question of my own choosing. Not what I was expecting, but an interesting opportunity regardless.
I worked with Ishank and Andy (the new team member this semester) to come up with a research question that we all thought was interesting.
We settled on reproducing a paper that focused on the network structure of Venmo interactions. The idea was to bootstrap with the paper's methods, and then take them further.
The goal seemed reasonable even though we had limited experience with graph analysis.

From the start I realized the project would be quite a bit more work than I originally thought, but I was ready.
That being said, at the beginning of the semester all three team members were heavily focused on internship/full-time job recruiting, which for software means heavy technical interview prep.
As a result, we often had difficulties meeting or allocating time to the project because we would all prioritize interviews. It turns out deciding what to do next in life can be quite stressful.
I don't think any of us realized how much time recruitment would take, in addition to all the other courses we were taking (Andy and I also had senior design projects to work on).

I don't mean to have this page as an excuse for lack of results, but rather a reflection and learning experience on how to properly manage time for an open ended research project that does not have clearly defined goals like a class assignment would.
Anyone who is taking on such a project should understand this, and I don't want people to make the same mistakes we did.

Now we finally have a designated lab space which I think will be extremely helpful for collaboration in the future.
