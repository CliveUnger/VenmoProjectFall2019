# Venmo Project Fall 2019

This repo serves as reference and knowledgebase for the work completed during the Fall of 2019 by Clive Unger, Ishank Arora, and Andy Chang in the UT Computational Media Lab

## Getting Started
[Setting up Python 3, Jupyter Notebook, and Spark 2.4 on TACC](./TACC-Wrangler-Python-3-and-Spark-2-4-Setup.md)

[Running a batch job on TACC](https://portal.tacc.utexas.edu/user-guides/stampede2#slurm-job-scheduler)
(This documentation is for Stampede2, but the same process applies for any TACC resource)

## Technical Challenges
The dataset is large enough that it can't be fit into memory, so there are many challenges that come with that. We have written up a comprehensive log of the various challenges we faced and how they were resolved.

## Data
Reference to the data locations in TACC since data cannot be uploaded to GitHub

## Notebooks
Loading the Data in Spark
Flattening the Data
Creating a Graph Representation of the Data
Basic Graph Manipulation with Spark and Graphframes
Clustering Coefficient example (which turned out to be incorrect)
Splitting the data per month
SNAP
NetworKit

## Useful Links
Apache Spark
Graph Frames
